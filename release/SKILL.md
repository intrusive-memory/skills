# Release Workflow

This skill manages the release process for projects that use PR-based releases with git tags and GitHub releases.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- A PR has already been merged to main
- You need to tag the merge commit
- You need to create a GitHub release
- You need to sync development with main after release

## Pre-flight Checks

Before starting the release process, verify:

### 1. Find the PR to Release

```bash
# Check for open PRs ready to merge
gh pr list --state open --base main --json number,title,statusCheckRollup
```

**If no open PR exists, STOP and ask: "Which PR should be released?"**

**If PR has failing checks, STOP and report: "PR has failing CI checks. Fix them before releasing."**

### 2. Determine Next Version Number

```bash
# Get the last tag
git fetch --tags
git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "No tags found"
```

The next version is always the last tag + 1:
- If last tag is `v29`, next is `v30`
- If last tag is `v1.2.3`, next is `v1.2.4`

**Ask the user to confirm the version number before proceeding.**

## Release Process

Once pre-flight checks pass:

### Step 1: Merge the PR (DO NOT USE LOCAL GIT MERGE)

```bash
gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> --merge --delete-branch=false --subject "..." --body "..."
```

**CRITICAL**: ALWAYS use `gh pr merge` to merge into main, NEVER use local `git merge`.

### Step 2: Checkout main and pull the merge commit

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify we're on the merge commit

```bash
git log -1 --oneline
```

### Step 4: Create and push the tag

```bash
git tag -a "v<VERSION>" -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Release v<VERSION>

<Brief description of what's in this release>

git push origin v<VERSION>
```

### Step 4: Create GitHub release

```bash
gh release create "v<VERSION>" \
  --title "v<VERSION>" \
  --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
## What's New in v<VERSION>

```

### Step 5: Report Success

Report:
- ✅ Released version v<VERSION>
- 📦 GitHub release: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/releases/tag/v<VERSION>
- 📋 Reminder: Development branch will naturally stay ahead of main with continued work

## Important Rules

1. **ALWAYS use `gh pr merge` to merge PRs** - NEVER use local `git merge` to merge into main
2. **ALWAYS ask user to confirm version number** - Don't guess
3. **ALWAYS use annotated tags** (`git tag -a`) - Include metadata
4. **NEVER force push** - Releases are permanent
5. **NEVER use local git merge commands** - All merges happen via GitHub PR mechanism

## Workflow Summary

```
1. Find open PR ready to merge
2. Verify PR has passing CI checks
3. Determine next version (last tag + 1)
4. Ask user to confirm version
5. Merge PR using gh pr merge (NEVER local git merge)
6. Checkout main and pull the merge commit
7. Tag the merge commit
8. Push the tag
9. Create GitHub release
```
